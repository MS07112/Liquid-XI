Liquid-XI is a project intended to create a more fluid 'Bot', which uses StarCraft Brood War as a general test-bed for development.

The main intent behind this bot: is to create a so-called 'Self-Aware' AI. One that is able to 'observe' its own actions and improve upon them by using a modified ODA (Observe Decide Act) Loop. Eventually, however: it is hoped that this system will be able to Design/Innovate new strategies, tactics, and other behaviors.

From what I've seen in the world of AI, the architecture for this Bot will likely appear very novel. Although it is really more a set of methods derived from mathematical models/abstractions of various Problem Solving Strategies and Design methods.


The project will likely implement some code from David Churchill's UAlbertaBot. 

The Brood War API (BWAPI) and Broodwar Terrain Analyzer 2 (BWTA2) projects are used as the main interfaces to the StarCraft program.

Although the above projects are heavily reliant on C++ for their code, it is intended that this project will be (mainly) written in F# for its conciseness, metaprogramming capabilities, and its direct connection to the .NET Framework; which allows it to be readily interfaced with other languages like C#, Visual Basic, Visual C++, etc.
